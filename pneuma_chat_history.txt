[2025-06-21 00:13:19] Bot (student_travel_benefits): Most airlines allow musical instruments, but policies vary.  Check with your airline (e.g., Emirates, Air India, Singapore Airlines) for specifics.  You might need to pay extra and/or pre-book.  

For student travel, explore student fares and discounts!  Emirates offers 10% off plus 10kg extra baggage; Air India gives 20kg extra; Singapore Airlines offers a 10% discount.  You'll typically need a valid student ID or enrollment letter for verification.
